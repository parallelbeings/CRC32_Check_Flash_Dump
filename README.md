## Utility to find CRC32 checksum tables or entries in a binary read from a SPI/I2C NOR flash 

When we dump a flash memory in an embedded device we would like to check whether the binary has stored an CRC32 checksum with it. The checksum can be either in a table or an entry after each block/sector/page. 

### How it works:

1. The script will read the given binary contents in block/sector/pages.
2. The script calculates a CRC32 value for each block/sector/pages and then bruteforce/search for a CRC32 checksum value in the binary. Returns "-1" or "address of the crc value" when a match crc32 value is found.

For example, the tool  was written for a GD25VE16C SPI NOR flash(16Mb/2MB) dump read from an accucheck medical device. The datasheeet of the flash memory mentions the memory organization and how the Block/Sector/Page size is defined.

The memory organization for the above example is,

* Each Device has - 2M bytes
* Each Block has - 64K/32K bytes
* Each Sector has - 4K bytes
* Each Page has - 256 bytes

So the value defined in the script(Line 11-13) is, 

* page_size = 0xFF  #256 bytes
* sector_size = 0xFFF  #4095 bytes
* block_size = 0xFFFF  #65535 bytes

### How to use:

1. Add the binary name to be checked in the crc32_check.py - Line 7. 
2. Verify/Change the memory organization as per the target memory you want to check the crc entries - Line 11-13. 
3. Install the python library requirements.
4. Run the tool. 
``` 
python3 crc32_check.py
```

### Pending:
1. To check an crc value in MSB or LSB first. Currently the script only searches for CRC value in Big endian mode(MSB first) but most microcontrollers store values in flash in little endian format. 
2. Support for checking CRC16. Many microcontroller uses 16bit CRC checksum instead of CRC32 due to processing overhead. Again it is implementation specific.
